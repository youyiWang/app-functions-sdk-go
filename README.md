# Application Functions SDK

Welcome the App Functions SDK for EdgeX. This sdk is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting data out of EdgeX. 

For documentation please visit https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/1.2/microservices/application/ApplServices/.
For a list of examples please visit https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/1.2/examples/AppServiceExamples/

## Build Prerequisites sadf

Please see the [edgex-go README](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go/blob/master/README.md).

## Versioning

Please refer to the EdgeX Foundry [versioning policy](https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21823969) for information on how EdgeX services are released and how EdgeX services are compatible with one another.  Specifically, device services (and the associated SDK), application services (and the associated app functions SDK), and client tools (like the EdgeX CLI and UI) can have independent minor releases, but these services must be compatible with the latest major release of EdgeX.

## Long Term Support

Please refer to the EdgeX Foundry [LTS policy](https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/display/FA/Long+Term+Support) for information on support of EdgeX releases. The EdgeX community does not offer support on any non-LTS release outside of the latest release.
